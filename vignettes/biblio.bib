abstract="We generalize the notion of B-spline to the thin plate splines and to otherd-dimensional polyharmonic splines as defined in [Duchon, [3]]; for regular nets, we give the main properties of these ``B-splines'': Fourier transform, decay when ∥x∥ {\textrightarrow} ∞, stability, integration property, links between B-splines of different orders or of different dimensions and in particular link with the polynomial B-splines, approximation using B-splines... We show that, in some sense, B-splines may be considered as a regularized form of the Dirac distribution.",

title="Barycentric rational interpolation with no poles and high rates of approximation",

volume="107",
number="2",
pages="315--331",
abstract="It is well known that rational interpolation sometimes gives better approximations than polynomial interpolation, especially for large sequences of points, but it is difficult to control the occurrence of poles. In this paper we propose and study a family of barycentric rational interpolants that have no real poles and arbitrarily high approximation orders on any real interval, regardless of the distribution of the points. These interpolants depend linearly on the data and include a construction of Berrut as a special case.",
